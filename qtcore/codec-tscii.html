<p>The TSCII codec provides conversion to and from the Tamil TSCII encoding.</p>
<p>TSCII, formally the Tamil Standard Code Information Interchange specification, is a commonly used charset for Tamils. The official page for the standard is at <a href="http://www.tamil.net/tscii/">http://www.tamil.net/tscii/</a></p>
<p>This codec uses the mapping table found at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/tsciiset.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/tsciiset.html</a>. Tamil uses composed Unicode which might cause some problems if you are using Unicode fonts instead of TSCII fonts.</p>
