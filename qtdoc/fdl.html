   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of <span class="keyword">this</span> license document<span class="operator">,</span> but changing it is <span class="keyword">not</span> allowed<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">0.</span> PREAMBLE

  The purpose of <span class="keyword">this</span> License is to make a manual<span class="operator">,</span> textbook<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> other
  functional and useful document <span class="string">&quot;free&quot;</span> in the sense of freedom: to
  assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it<span class="operator">,</span>
  with <span class="keyword">or</span> without modifying it<span class="operator">,</span> either commercially <span class="keyword">or</span> noncommercially<span class="operator">.</span>
  Secondarily<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> License preserves <span class="keyword">for</span> the author and publisher a way
  to get credit <span class="keyword">for</span> their work<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> being considered responsible
  <span class="keyword">for</span> modifications made by others<span class="operator">.</span>

  This License is a kind of <span class="string">&quot;copyleft&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span> which means that derivative
  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense<span class="operator">.</span>  It
  complements the GNU General Public License<span class="operator">,</span> which is a copyleft
  license designed <span class="keyword">for</span> free software<span class="operator">.</span>

  We have designed <span class="keyword">this</span> License in order to use it <span class="keyword">for</span> manuals <span class="keyword">for</span> free
  software<span class="operator">,</span> because free software needs free documentation: a free
  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
  software does<span class="operator">.</span>  But <span class="keyword">this</span> License is <span class="keyword">not</span> limited to software manuals;
  it can be used <span class="keyword">for</span> any textual work<span class="operator">,</span> regardless of subject matter <span class="keyword">or</span>
  whether it is published as a printed book<span class="operator">.</span>  We recommend <span class="keyword">this</span> License
  principally <span class="keyword">for</span> works whose purpose is instruction <span class="keyword">or</span> reference<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">1.</span> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

  This License applies to any manual <span class="keyword">or</span> other work<span class="operator">,</span> in any medium<span class="operator">,</span> that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
  distributed under the terms of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>  Such a notice grants a
  world<span class="operator">-</span>wide<span class="operator">,</span> royalty<span class="operator">-</span>free license<span class="operator">,</span> unlimited in duration<span class="operator">,</span> to use that
  work under the conditions stated herein<span class="operator">.</span>  The <span class="string">&quot;Document&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span> below<span class="operator">,</span>
  refers to any such manual <span class="keyword">or</span> work<span class="operator">.</span>  Any member of the <span class="keyword">public</span> is a
  licensee<span class="operator">,</span> and is addressed as <span class="string">&quot;you&quot;</span><span class="operator">.</span>  You accept the license <span class="keyword">if</span> you
  copy<span class="operator">,</span> modify <span class="keyword">or</span> distribute the work in a way requiring permission
  under copyright law<span class="operator">.</span>

  A <span class="string">&quot;Modified Version&quot;</span> of the Document means any work containing the
  Document <span class="keyword">or</span> a portion of it<span class="operator">,</span> either copied verbatim<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> with
  modifications and<span class="operator">/</span><span class="keyword">or</span> translated into another language<span class="operator">.</span>

  A <span class="string">&quot;Secondary Section&quot;</span> is a named appendix <span class="keyword">or</span> a front<span class="operator">-</span>matter section of
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
  publishers <span class="keyword">or</span> authors of the Document to the Document<span class="char">'s overall
  subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
  directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
  part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
  any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
  them.

  The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
  Sections then there are none.

  The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

  A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
  of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
  proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
  processors for output purposes only.

  The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
  formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work'</span>s title<span class="operator">,</span>
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text<span class="operator">.</span>

  The <span class="string">&quot;publisher&quot;</span> means any person <span class="keyword">or</span> entity that distributes copies of
  the Document to the <span class="keyword">public</span><span class="operator">.</span>

  A section <span class="string">&quot;Entitled XYZ&quot;</span> means a named subunit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ <span class="keyword">or</span> contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language<span class="operator">.</span>  (Here XYZ stands <span class="keyword">for</span> a
  specific section name mentioned below<span class="operator">,</span> such as <span class="string">&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span>
  <span class="string">&quot;Dedications&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="string">&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="string">&quot;History&quot;</span><span class="operator">.</span>)  To <span class="string">&quot;Preserve the Title&quot;</span>
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
  section <span class="string">&quot;Entitled XYZ&quot;</span> according to <span class="keyword">this</span> definition<span class="operator">.</span>

  The Document may <span class="keyword">include</span> Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
  states that <span class="keyword">this</span> License applies to the Document<span class="operator">.</span>  These Warranty
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in <span class="keyword">this</span>
  License<span class="operator">,</span> but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is <span class="type">void</span> and has
  no effect on the meaning of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">2.</span> VERBATIM COPYING

  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium<span class="operator">,</span> either
  commercially <span class="keyword">or</span> noncommercially<span class="operator">,</span> provided that <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> the
  copyright notices<span class="operator">,</span> and the license notice saying <span class="keyword">this</span> License applies
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies<span class="operator">,</span> and that you add no
  other conditions whatsoever to those of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>  You may <span class="keyword">not</span> use
  technical measures to obstruct <span class="keyword">or</span> control the reading <span class="keyword">or</span> further
  copying of the copies you make <span class="keyword">or</span> distribute<span class="operator">.</span>  However<span class="operator">,</span> you may accept
  compensation in exchange <span class="keyword">for</span> copies<span class="operator">.</span>  If you distribute a large enough
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section <span class="number">3.</span>

  You may also lend copies<span class="operator">,</span> under the same conditions stated above<span class="operator">,</span> and
  you may publicly display copies<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">3.</span> COPYING IN QUANTITY

  If you publish printed copies (<span class="keyword">or</span> copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document<span class="operator">,</span> numbering more than <span class="number">100</span><span class="operator">,</span> and the
  Document<span class="char">'s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
  as verbatim copying in other respects.

  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
  pages.

  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
  edition to the public.

  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
  give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
  Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
     Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
     unless they release you from this requirement.
  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
     and required Cover Texts given in the Document'</span>s license notice<span class="operator">.</span>
  H<span class="operator">.</span> Include an unaltered copy of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>
  I<span class="operator">.</span> Preserve the section Entitled <span class="string">&quot;History&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span> Preserve its Title<span class="operator">,</span> and add
     to it an item stating at least the title<span class="operator">,</span> year<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> authors<span class="operator">,</span> and
     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page<span class="operator">.</span>  If
     there is no section Entitled <span class="string">&quot;History&quot;</span> in the Document<span class="operator">,</span> create one
     stating the title<span class="operator">,</span> year<span class="operator">,</span> authors<span class="operator">,</span> and publisher of the Document as
     given on its Title Page<span class="operator">,</span> then add an item describing the Modified
     Version as stated in the previous sentence<span class="operator">.</span>
  J<span class="operator">.</span> Preserve the network location<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> any<span class="operator">,</span> given in the Document <span class="keyword">for</span>
     <span class="keyword">public</span> access to a Transparent copy of the Document<span class="operator">,</span> and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document <span class="keyword">for</span> previous versions
     it was based on<span class="operator">.</span>  These may be placed in the <span class="string">&quot;History&quot;</span> section<span class="operator">.</span>
     You may omit a network location <span class="keyword">for</span> a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission<span class="operator">.</span>
  K<span class="operator">.</span> For any section Entitled <span class="string">&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="string">&quot;Dedications&quot;</span><span class="operator">,</span>
     Preserve the Title of the section<span class="operator">,</span> and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and<span class="operator">/</span><span class="keyword">or</span> dedications given therein<span class="operator">.</span>
  L<span class="operator">.</span> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document<span class="operator">,</span>
     unaltered in their text and in their titles<span class="operator">.</span>  Section numbers
     <span class="keyword">or</span> the equivalent are <span class="keyword">not</span> considered part of the section titles<span class="operator">.</span>
  M<span class="operator">.</span> Delete any section Entitled <span class="string">&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span><span class="operator">.</span>  Such a section
     may <span class="keyword">not</span> be included in the Modified Version<span class="operator">.</span>
  N<span class="operator">.</span> Do <span class="keyword">not</span> retitle any existing section to be Entitled <span class="string">&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span>
     <span class="keyword">or</span> to conflict in title with any Invariant Section<span class="operator">.</span>
  O<span class="operator">.</span> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers<span class="operator">.</span>

  If the Modified Version includes <span class="keyword">new</span> front<span class="operator">-</span>matter sections <span class="keyword">or</span>
  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
  copied from the Document<span class="operator">,</span> you may at your option designate some <span class="keyword">or</span> all
  of these sections as invariant<span class="operator">.</span>  To <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">this</span><span class="operator">,</span> add their titles to the
  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version<span class="char">'s license notice.
  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

  You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
  parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
  standard.

  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
  license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
  in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
  &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
  and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
  Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
  documents released under this License, and replace the individual
  copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
  that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
  of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
  other respects.

  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
  distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
  copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
  License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
  document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
  resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
  of the compilation'</span>s users beyond what the individual works permit<span class="operator">.</span>
  When the Document is included in an aggregate<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> License does <span class="keyword">not</span>
  apply to the other works in the aggregate which are <span class="keyword">not</span> themselves
  derivative works of the Document<span class="operator">.</span>

  If the Cover Text requirement of section <span class="number">3</span> is applicable to these
  copies of the Document<span class="operator">,</span> then <span class="keyword">if</span> the Document is less than one half of
  the entire aggregate<span class="operator">,</span> the Document<span class="char">'s Cover Texts may be placed on
  covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
  electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
  aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
  translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
  Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions
  of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
  the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

  If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
  &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
  title.

  9. TERMINATION

  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
  terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
  fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
  60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
  not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
  GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
  detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
  License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
  specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
  License can be used, that proxy'</span>s <span class="keyword">public</span> statement of acceptance of a
  version permanently authorizes you to choose that version <span class="keyword">for</span> the
  Document<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">11.</span> RELICENSING

  <span class="string">&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot;</span> (<span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="string">&quot;MMC Site&quot;</span>) means any
