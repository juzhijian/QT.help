    An <span class="string">&quot;Application&quot;</span> is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library<span class="operator">,</span> but which is <span class="keyword">not</span> otherwise based on the Library<span class="operator">.</span>
  Defining a subclass of a <span class="keyword">class</span> defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of <span class="keyword">using</span> an interface provided by the Library<span class="operator">.</span>

  Application with the Library<span class="operator">.</span>  The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the <span class="string">&quot;Linked

    <span class="number">1.</span> Exception to Section <span class="number">3</span> of the GNU GPL<span class="operator">.</span>

    <span class="number">2.</span> Conveying Modified Versions<span class="operator">.</span>

    If you modify a copy of the Library<span class="operator">,</span> and<span class="operator">,</span> in your modifications<span class="operator">,</span> a
  facility refers to a function <span class="keyword">or</span> data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked)<span class="operator">,</span> then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

     a) under <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that<span class="operator">,</span> in the event an Application does <span class="keyword">not</span> supply the

     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span>

     b) under the GNU GPL<span class="operator">,</span> with none of the additional permissions of
     <span class="keyword">this</span> License applicable to that copy<span class="operator">.</span>

    <span class="number">3.</span> Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files<span class="operator">.</span>

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library<span class="operator">.</span>  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice<span class="operator">,</span> provided that<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> the incorporated
  material is <span class="keyword">not</span> limited to numerical parameters<span class="operator">,</span> data structure

  (ten <span class="keyword">or</span> fewer lines in length)<span class="operator">,</span> you <span class="keyword">do</span> both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and <span class="keyword">this</span> license
     document<span class="operator">.</span>

    <span class="number">4.</span> Combined Works<span class="operator">.</span>

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that<span class="operator">,</span>
  taken together<span class="operator">,</span> effectively <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering <span class="keyword">for</span> debugging such modifications<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> you also <span class="keyword">do</span> each of
  the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and <span class="keyword">this</span> license
     document<span class="operator">.</span>

     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
     execution<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">include</span> the copyright notice <span class="keyword">for</span> the Library among
     these notices<span class="operator">,</span> as well as a reference directing the user to the
     copies of the GNU GPL and <span class="keyword">this</span> license document<span class="operator">.</span>

     d) Do one of the following:

         <span class="number">0</span>) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of <span class="keyword">this</span>
         License<span class="operator">,</span> and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
         suitable <span class="keyword">for</span><span class="operator">,</span> and under terms that permit<span class="operator">,</span> the user to
         recombine <span class="keyword">or</span> relink the Application with a modified version of
         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work<span class="operator">,</span> in the
         manner specified by section <span class="number">6</span> of the GNU GPL <span class="keyword">for</span> conveying
         Corresponding Source<span class="operator">.</span>

         <span class="number">1</span>) Use a suitable shared library mechanism <span class="keyword">for</span> linking with the
         Library<span class="operator">.</span>  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
         a copy of the Library already present on the user<span class="char">'s computer
         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
         Version.

     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
     for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
     conveyed under the terms of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy'</span>s <span class="keyword">public</span> statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization <span class="keyword">for</span> you to choose that version <span class="keyword">for</span> the
  Library<span class="operator">.</span>
