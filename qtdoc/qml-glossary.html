<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Qt Quick</td><td >The standard library of types and functionality for the QML language, which is provided by the Qt Quick module, and may be accessed with &quot;import <a href="../qtqml/qtquick-qmlmodule.html">QtQuick</a> 2.3&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >Type</td><td >In QML, a <i>type</i> may refer to either a <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">Basic Type</a> or a <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">QML Object Type</a>.<p>The QML language provides a number of built in (<a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">basic types</a>), and the Qt Quick module provides various <a href="../qtquick/qtquick-qmlmodule.html">Qt Quick types</a> for building QML applications. Types can also be provided by third-party developers through (<a href="../qtqml/qtqml-modules-topic.html">modules</a>) or by the application developer in the application itself through <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-documents-definetypes.html">QML Documents</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">The QML Type System</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Basic Type</td><td >A <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">basic type</a> is a simple type such as <code>int</code>, <code>string</code> and <code>bool</code>. Unlike <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">object types</a>, an object cannot be instantiated from a basic type; for example, it is not possible to create an <code>int</code> object with properties, methods, signals and so on.<p>Basic types are built into the QML language, whereas object types cannot be used unless the appropriate <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-modules-topic.html">module</a> is imported.</p>
<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">The QML Type System</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >Object Type</td><td >A <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">QML Object Type</a> is a type that can be instantiated by the QML engine.<p>A QML type can be defined either by a document in a .qml file beginning with a capital letter, or by a <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a>-based C++ class.</p>
<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">The QML Type System</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Object</td><td >A QML object is an instance of a <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-typesystem-topic.html">QML Object Type</a>.<p>Such objects are created by the engine when it processes <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-basics.html">object declarations</a>, which specify the objects to be created and the attributes that are to be defined for each object.</p>
<p>Additionally, objects can be dynamically created at runtime through Component.createObject() and Qt.createQmlObject().</p>
<p>See also <a href="qml-glossary.html#lazy-instantiation">Lazy Instantiation</a>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >Component</td><td >A component is a template from which a QML object or object tree is created. It is produced when a document is loaded by the QML engine. Once it has been loaded, it can be used to instantiate the object or object tree that it represents.<p>Additionally, the <a href="../qtqml/qml-qtqml-component.html">Component</a> type is a special type that can can be used to declare a component inline within a document. Component objects can also be dynamically created through Qt.createComponent() to dynamically create QML objects.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Document</td><td >A <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-documents-topic.html">QML Document</a> is a self contained piece of QML source code that begins with one or more import statements and contains a single top-level object declaration. A document may reside in a .qml file or a text string.<p>If it is placed in a .qml file whose name begins with a capital letter, the file is recognized by the engine as a definition of a QML type. The top-level object declaration encapsulates the object tree that will be instantiated by the type.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >Property</td><td >A property is an attribute of an object type that has a name and an associated value; this value can be read (and in most cases, also written to) externally.<p>An object can have one or more properties. Some properties are associated with the canvas (e.g&#x2e;, x, y, width, height, and opacity) while others may be data specific to that type (e.g&#x2e;, the &quot;text&quot; property of the <a href="whatsnew50.html#text">Text</a> type).</p>
<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html">QML Object Attributes</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Binding</td><td >A binding is a JavaScript expression which is &quot;bound&quot; to a property. The value of the property at any point in time will be the value returned by evaluating that expression.<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-propertybinding.html">Property Binding</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >Signal</td><td >A signal is a notification from a QML object. When an object emits a signal, other objects can receive and process this signal through a <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html#signal-attributes">signal handler</a>.<p>Most properties of QML objects have a change signal, and also an associated change signal handler which may be defined by clients to implement functionality. For example, the &quot;onClicked()&quot; handler of an instance of the <a href="../qtquick/qml-qtquick-mousearea.html">MouseArea</a> type might be defined in an application to cause a sound to be played.</p>
<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-signals.html">Signal and Handler Event System</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >Signal Handler</td><td >A signal handler is the expression (or function) which is triggered by a signal. It is also known as a &quot;slot&quot; in C++.<p>See <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-syntax-signals.html">Signal and Handler Event System</a> for more details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><a name="lazy-instantiation"></a><td >Lazy Instantiation</td><td >Object instances can be instantiated &quot;lazily&quot; at run-time, to avoid performing unnecessary work until needed. Qt Quick provides the <a href="../qtquick/qml-qtquick-loader.html">Loader</a> type to make lazy instantiation more convenient.</td></tr>
