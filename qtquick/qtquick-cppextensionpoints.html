<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>All QML applications can be extended from C++ in order to use additional functionality implemented in C++ code or to provide a C++ based QML plugin. This topic of extending QML from C++ is covered in the <a href="../qtqml/qtqml-cppintegration-topic.html">Integrating QML and C++</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Qt Quick module provides several extension and integration points for C++ developers, specific to this module. In particular, it allows C++ developers to create and register custom <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a>-derived types which can be rendered by Qt Quick. It also provides several scene graph-related classes which allow developers to define their own rendering primitives.</p>

<h2 id="user-defined-qquickitem-derived-types">User-Defined QQuickItem-Derived Types</h2>
<p>While the Qt Quick module already provides a rich library of visual item types for use in a QML application, some developers may wish to define their own item-derived types in C++ and expose them to the QML type system. The easiest way to do this is to subclass <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a>, which is the base type for all visual types in the Qt Quick module. See the <a href="qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<a name="scene-graph-related-classes"></a><a name="scene-graph-related-classes"></a>
<h2 id="scene-graph-related-classes">Scene Graph-Related Classes</h2>
<p>Qt Quick 2 makes use of a dedicated scene graph based on OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0 for its rendering. Using a scene graph for graphics rather than the traditional imperative painting systems (<a href="../qtgui/qpainter.html">QPainter</a> and similar), means the scene to be rendered can be retained between frames and the complete set of primitives to render is known before rendering starts. This opens up for a number of optimizations, such as batching the OpenGL draw calls to minimize state changes or discarding obscured primitives.</p>
<p>The <a href="qtquick-module.html">Qt Quick C++ API</a> provides various classes to enable custom nodes to be created in C++.</p>
<p>See the <a href="qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html">Qt Quick Scene Graph</a> documentation for details.</p>

<h2 id="pixmap-and-threaded-image-support">Pixmap and Threaded Image Support</h2>
<p>While the QML engine allows QML application to load images from filesystem or network resources, some applications may require the additional option of loading images from C++ based processes. This can be implemented through the <a href="qquickimageprovider.html">QQuickImageProvider</a> class, which provides support for pixmap loading and threaded image requests for QML applications. Any QML application that requests an image through the special &quot;image:&quot; URL scheme will be directed to an appropriate image provider to load the image.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="qquickimageprovider.html">QQuickImageProvider</a> documentation.</p>
